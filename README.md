# ComfyUI-Transformers-Pipeline

Some additional ComfyUI nodes allowing tasks via the Huggingface Transformers Pipeline.

## TODO

- Add tooltips & better labels
- Add config options (`config.ini` or `.toml`) or something else
- Clean up EXIF metadata extraction
- Allow additional tasks on the pipeline
- Allow multiple passes with additional models to add flexible options to the output
- Make all this pretty
- Make a better readme
- Add to registry once this all works well.
